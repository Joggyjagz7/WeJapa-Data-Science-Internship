#Quiz: Calculate
#In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.
 floor_part_one = 9 * 7
 floor_part_two = 5 * 7

 total_titles = floor_part_one + floor_part_two
 print(total_titles)

 17_pack = 17 * 6
 left_over = 17_pack - total_titles
 print(left_over)
